### Domain Model

### View Model
- Not sure if Gernics work with EMF  (ClassIndexView, ClassOperationView)
- (ClassIndexView, ClassOperationView, ListViewElement, TableViewElement) ... There should be a lot of specific
stuff about associated class instances/instance, no idea if that thing is correct :-)

- SelectionViewElement, the text confuses me 

 > A selection view element defines the selectable values called selection items. A special type of selection items are enumeration literal items that offer enumeration literals defined in a domain model as selectable values.
