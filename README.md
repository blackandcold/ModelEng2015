### Domain Model
- [Bernd] ~~Maybe Property should have a attribute isID instead of Class having a ID property?~~

> Classes have a name and contain properties.
One of the contained or inherited properties (cf. inheritance concept described at the bottom of the table) serves as the unique identifier (id) of the class.


### View Model

- [Bernd] Not sure if Gernics work with EMF  (ClassIndexView, ClassOperationView)
- [Bernd] *ClassIndexView, ClassOperationView, ListViewElement, TableViewElement* ... There should be a lot of specific
stuff about associated class instances/instance, no idea if that thing is correct :-)

 > List: A list shows associated class instances in the form of a list that displays the instancesâ€™ id property.

- [Bernd] SelectionViewElement, the text confuses me 

 > A selection view element defines the selectable values called selection items. A special type of selection items are enumeration literal items that offer enumeration literals defined in a domain model as selectable values.

- [Bernd] ~~propertyRef: display only properties of class specified in ClassOperationView~~

- [Bernd] List & Table Elements should have entries and columns and also Links?

- [Bernd] isPropertyMemberOfClass Missing SuperClass property
